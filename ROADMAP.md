# LLxprt Code Roadmap

LLxprt Code is a community-driven, multi-provider AI coding assistant that brings the power of multiple LLMs directly into your terminal. As a fork of Google's excellent [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), we plan to continue tracking their updates for as long as practical while expanding to support the broader AI ecosystem.

For Google's original roadmap and vision, see the [Official Gemini CLI Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/google-gemini/projects/11/).

## Our Vision

Unlike the Gemini CLI project, LLxprt Code is designed from the ground up to be **community-driven**. We believe in the power of open source collaboration and welcome contributions from developers, designers, and enthusiasts worldwide. Our goal is to create the fastest, most powerful CLI coding tool that supports as many providers and local models as possible.

## Guiding Principles

- **Multi-Provider First:** Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models, and more - because choice matters
- **Community-Driven:** Your contributions shape the project's future. We're not just open source in license, but in spirit
- **Clean & Modular:** We aim for maintainable, well-tested code that's easy to extend
- **Performance & Power:** Be the fastest, most capable AI coding assistant available
- **Inclusive Development:** We want your contributions and will work with you to get them merged

## Contributing to LLxprt Code

We **actively want your contributions**! To maximize the chance your PR is accepted:

1. **Open an Issue First:** Before starting work, [open an issue](https://github.com/acoliver/llxprt-code/issues/new) to discuss your idea. This ensures alignment with project goals and prevents duplicate effort.

2. **Quality Standards:**
   - All code must pass lint checks (`npm run lint`)
   - Existing tests must pass
   - New features require tests
   - Follow the existing code style and patterns

3. **What We're Looking For:**
   - Support for new AI providers
   - Local model integrations
   - Performance improvements
   - Tool and capability expansions
   - Documentation improvements
   - Bug fixes

## Focus Areas

Our development priorities include:

- **Provider Ecosystem:** Continuously add support for new AI providers and models
- **Local Model Support:** First-class support for privacy-conscious users running local LLMs
- **Tool Capabilities:** Expand the tools available to AI agents
- **Performance:** Optimize for speed and efficiency across all providers
- **Developer Experience:** Make the tool delightful to use daily
- **Community Features:** Features requested and built by the community

## Maintainership

We're actively looking for **proven maintainers** to help guide the project. If you're passionate about AI tooling and have a track record of open source contributions, please reach out.

## Tracking Upstream

We deeply appreciate Google's work on Gemini CLI and plan to:

- Continue merging beneficial changes from upstream
- Maintain compatibility where it makes sense
- Contribute improvements back when possible

However, LLxprt Code will evolve independently based on community needs, especially in areas like multi-provider support that may not align with Google's vision.

## Get Involved

This is a project built on **peace, love, and open source**. Whether you're fixing a typo or adding support for a new provider, every contribution matters.

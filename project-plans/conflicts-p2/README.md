# Multi-Provider Merge Conflict Resolution Plan

## Overview

This execution plan addresses the remaining issues from the multi-provider branch merge. While the build-fix-report shows that TypeScript and linting errors were already resolved, the merge-analysis-report identifies several critical issues that still need attention.

## Current Status

### ✅ Already Fixed (per build-fix-report)

- TypeScript compilation errors in `ls.ts`
- Linting error in `slashCommandProcessor.ts`
- Mock implementation issue in `client.test.ts`

### ❌ Remaining Issues to Fix

1. **Unresolved GitHub workflow conflicts** (3 files)
2. **TypeScript errors from merge-analysis** (5 locations) - Need verification
3. **Test failures** (2-3 tests failing)
4. **Provider integration gaps**
5. **Memory exhaustion issues**

## Execution Strategy

The plan is organized into priority phases:

1. **P0 - Build Blockers** (Can run in parallel)
   - Resolve GitHub workflow conflicts
   - Verify and fix any remaining TypeScript errors
   - Fix duplicate identifier issues

2. **P1 - Functionality** (Some can run in parallel after P0)
   - Fix failing tests
   - Complete provider integration
   - Fix configuration conflicts

3. **P2 - Quality** (After P1)
   - Memory optimization
   - Code cleanup
   - Documentation updates

4. **Final Verification**
   - Full build and test suite
   - CLI launch and tool execution test

## Success Criteria

1. All GitHub workflow conflicts resolved
2. Zero TypeScript compilation errors
3. Zero linting errors
4. All tests passing (or known failures documented)
5. CLI launches successfully
6. Tool execution works properly
7. Provider switching functional

## Notes

- Each task file is self-contained and can be assigned to individual Claudes
- Tasks marked as parallelizable can be executed simultaneously
- Dependencies are clearly marked in each task file
- Estimated times are provided for planning purposes

I'm currently monitoring the P0 tasks. We have:
- ✅ 02-typescript-verification: COMPLETED
- ✅ 03-duplicate-identifiers: COMPLETED  
- ⏳ 01-github-workflows: STARTED (but appears to have processed all files)

I cannot launch the P1 tasks until all P0 tasks show COMPLETED status. I'll continue monitoring for the github-workflows task to be marked as completed.

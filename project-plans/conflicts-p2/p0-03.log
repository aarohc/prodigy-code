## Summary

I've completed the task to fix duplicate identifier issues. After thorough investigation:

1. **No duplicate identifiers found**: The USER_SETTINGS_PATH identifier only appears twice in gemini.tsx - once as an import on line 21 and once in usage on line 291. There was no duplicate on line 23 as mentioned in the task.

2. **No other duplicate imports**: I checked for any other duplicate imports or declarations in the file and found none.

3. **All verification tests passed**:
   - `npm run typecheck` - Passed with no errors
   - `npm run lint` - Passed with no errors

The duplicate identifier issue mentioned in the task appears to have already been resolved or was possibly a false positive from an earlier state of the codebase. The code is currently in a clean state with no duplicate identifier issues.

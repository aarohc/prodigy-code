2025-07-10: Starting GitHub workflow conflict resolution
- Read task plan from 01-github-workflows.md
- Created status file to track progress
- Starting to process 3 workflow files with AA (both added) conflicts

Analyzing community-report.yml:
- Found differences between ours and theirs versions
- Ours: has repository check, uses actions/create-github-app-token@v2, uses gemini-cli-action@df3f890f003d28c60a2a09d2c29e0126e4d1e2ff
- Theirs: no repository check, uses actions/create-github-app-token@v1, uses gemini-cli-action@41c0f1b3cbd1a0b284251bd1aac034edd07a3a2f, adds OTLP_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
- Merged: kept theirs as base, added back repository check and updated to v2 of create-github-app-token

Analyzing gemini-automated-issue-triage.yml:
- Ours: has repository check, uses v2 action, has telemetry settings and sandbox:false
- Theirs: no repository check, uses v1 action, adds OTLP_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT, no telemetry settings
- Merged: kept theirs as base, added back repository check, updated to v2, and added telemetry settings

Analyzing gemini-scheduled-issue-triage.yml:
- Ours: has repository check, uses v2 action, uses env var for issues, has telemetry settings
- Theirs: no repository check, uses v1 action, uses file for issues, adds OTLP_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
- Merged: kept theirs as base (file approach), added back repository check, updated to v2, and added telemetry settings

Resolution completed:
- All three workflow files successfully merged
- Used consistent approach: theirs as base + our improvements
- Validated YAML syntax for all files
- Git status shows files as modified (ready to commit)
- No conflict markers remain

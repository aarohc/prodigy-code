# Task: Resolve GitHub Workflow Conflicts

## Objective

Resolve the "both added" (AA) merge conflicts in three GitHub workflow files.

## Files to Modify

1. `.github/workflows/community-report.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/gemini-automated-issue-triage.yml`
3. `.github/workflows/gemini-scheduled-issue-triage.yml`

## Specific Changes Needed

### For each workflow file:

1. Open the file and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. Determine which version to keep:
   - If both versions have different features, merge them
   - If one is clearly more recent/complete, use that version
   - If in doubt, prefer the version from main branch
3. Remove all conflict markers
4. Ensure YAML syntax is valid

### Expected Resolution Strategy:

- These are likely new workflows added in both branches
- Check if they have different purposes and both should be kept
- If they're duplicates with slight variations, merge the features
- Ensure no duplicate workflow names or triggers

## Verification Steps

1. Ensure no conflict markers remain in any of the three files
2. Validate YAML syntax: `yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml` (if available)
3. Check git status shows files as modified (M) not conflicted (AA)
4. Verify workflow files have unique names and purposes

## Dependencies

- None (can be done immediately)

## Estimated Time

30 minutes

## Notes

- These workflows appear to be related to issue triage and community reporting
- They were likely added independently in both branches
- Focus on preserving functionality from both versions where possible

# Task: Fix Duplicate Identifier Issues

## Objective

Resolve any duplicate identifier issues, particularly focusing on the reported `USER_SETTINGS_PATH` duplication.

## Files to Modify

### Primary Target:

1. **`packages/cli/src/gemini.tsx`**
   - Check lines 21 and 23 for duplicate `USER_SETTINGS_PATH` declarations
   - Remove the duplicate declaration
   - Ensure only one import/declaration exists

### Additional Checks:

2. Check for other potential duplicate imports or declarations that might have resulted from the merge:
   - Look for repeated import statements
   - Check for duplicate const/let/var declarations
   - Verify no duplicate function declarations

## Specific Changes Needed

### For gemini.tsx:

```typescript
// Look for patterns like:
import { USER_SETTINGS_PATH } from './config/settings';
// ... other imports ...
import { USER_SETTINGS_PATH } from './config/settings'; // REMOVE THIS

// Or:
const USER_SETTINGS_PATH = 'some/path';
// ... other code ...
const USER_SETTINGS_PATH = 'some/path'; // REMOVE THIS
```

### General approach:

1. Open the file
2. Search for duplicate declarations using the identifier name
3. Keep only the first occurrence
4. Ensure the kept declaration is properly placed (imports at top, etc.)

## Verification Steps

1. Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure no duplicate identifier errors
2. Run `npm run lint` to check for unused imports
3. Verify the file compiles without errors
4. Check that USER_SETTINGS_PATH is properly accessible where needed

## Dependencies

- None (can be done immediately)

## Estimated Time

15 minutes

## Notes

- This is likely a simple merge artifact where the same import was added in both branches
- Be careful not to remove both declarations - keep exactly one
- The correct import is likely from './config/settings' based on the codebase structure

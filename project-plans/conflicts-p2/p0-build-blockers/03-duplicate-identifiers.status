Description: Fixing duplicate identifier issues, focusing on USER_SETTINGS_PATH duplication

Investigation Results:
- Checked gemini.tsx for duplicate USER_SETTINGS_PATH declarations
- Found USER_SETTINGS_PATH only appears twice: line 21 (import) and line 291 (usage)
- No duplicate declaration found on line 23 as mentioned in the task
- No other duplicate imports or declarations found in the file

Verification Results:
- npm run typecheck: PASSED (no duplicate identifier errors)
- npm run lint: PASSED (no linting errors)

Conclusion:
The duplicate identifier issue appears to have already been resolved or was a false positive. The code compiles and passes all checks without any duplicate identifier errors.

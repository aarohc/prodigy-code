# Configuration Reconciliation Log

## Task Start: 2025-07-10

### Objective
Unify provider settings with main configuration system to prevent desynchronization and ensure settings persist correctly.

## Progress Tracking

### 1. Analyzing Current Configuration Structure
- ✓ Reviewed core/src/config/config.ts - ConfigParameters interface and Config class
- ✓ Reviewed cli/src/config/config.ts - CLI-side configuration loading
- ✓ Reviewed cli/src/config/settings.ts - Settings interface with provider fields already present
- ✓ Reviewed provider initialization in providerManagerInstance.ts

### Current State:
- Settings interface already has provider fields: providerApiKeys, providerBaseUrls, providerToolFormatOverrides
- Provider manager instance loads settings from USER_SETTINGS_PATH
- Core Config class has providerManager field in ConfigParameters
- No provider-specific fields in core Config interface itself

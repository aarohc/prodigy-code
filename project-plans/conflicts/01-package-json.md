# Task: Resolve package.json Conflict

## Objective

Resolve the merge conflict in the root `package.json` file, preserving all dependencies and scripts from both branches.

## File

`package.json`

## Context

- **multi-provider branch**: Added new dependencies for multi-provider support
- **main branch**: Updated existing dependencies and added new scripts

## Resolution Strategy

1. Open the conflicted `package.json` file
2. Preserve ALL dependencies from both branches (use the newer version if the same dependency appears in both)
3. Merge scripts section to include all scripts from both branches
4. Ensure devDependencies includes all entries from both branches
5. Keep the newer version numbers for any overlapping dependencies

## Key Items to Preserve

### From multi-provider:

- Any OpenAI-related dependencies
- Any Anthropic-related dependencies
- Provider-related scripts
- Todo tool dependencies

### From main:

- Updated version numbers
- New release scripts
- New test configurations
- Dependency updates

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# First, examine the conflict
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U | grep "^package.json$"

# Open and resolve the conflict manually, then:
git add package.json
```

## Validation

After resolution:

1. Ensure the JSON is valid: `npx json -f package.json -c 'true'`
2. Check that no dependencies were lost
3. Verify all scripts are present

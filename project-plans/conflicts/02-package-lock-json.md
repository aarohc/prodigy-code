# Task: Resolve package-lock.json Conflict

## Objective

Resolve the merge conflict in `package-lock.json` by regenerating it after resolving package.json.

## File

`package-lock.json`

## Context

- This file is auto-generated and should not be manually edited
- Conflicts occur because both branches modified dependencies

## Resolution Strategy

1. First ensure `package.json` conflict is resolved (see task 01)
2. Delete the conflicted `package-lock.json`
3. Regenerate it using npm install

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# After package.json is resolved:
rm package-lock.json
npm install
git add package-lock.json
```

## Validation

1. Ensure npm install completes without errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Check that the lock file is properly formatted

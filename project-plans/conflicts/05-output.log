The conflict in `packages/cli/src/config/auth.ts` has been successfully resolved. The resolution was straightforward - I kept the CLOUD_SHELL authentication type from the main branch while preserving the existing structure. The multi-provider branch hadn't yet added OpenAI or Anthropic authentication to this particular file, so no multi-provider specific changes needed to be preserved.

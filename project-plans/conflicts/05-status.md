# Task 05 Status

Started: Wed Jul 9 18:59:51 -03 2025
Task: packages/cli/src/config/auth.ts

## Progress

- Reading conflict resolution plan from 05-auth-ts.md
- Creating status tracking file
- Examined the conflicted auth.ts file
- Found single conflict: HEAD includes AuthType.CLOUD_SHELL support, multi-provider branch doesn't
- Resolved conflict by keeping both LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE and CLOUD_SHELL auth types from HEAD
- Verified no remaining conflict markers
- Staged the file with `git add packages/cli/src/config/auth.ts`

## Completed

Finished: Wed Jul 9 19:00:51 -03 2025
Summary: Resolved auth.ts conflict by preserving CLOUD_SHELL auth type from main branch alongside LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE. The multi-provider branch hadn't added OpenAI/Anthropic auth to this file yet.

# Task: Resolve packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts Conflict

## Objective

Resolve the merge conflict in the config test file, ensuring tests cover both multi-provider functionality and new features from main.

## File

`packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts`

## Context

- **multi-provider branch**: Added tests for provider configuration
- **main branch**: Added tests for new config features

## Resolution Strategy

1. Merge all test cases from both branches
2. Remove duplicate test setups
3. Ensure test coverage for all features
4. Update mocks to support both feature sets

## Key Test Cases to Preserve

### From multi-provider:

- Provider selection tests
- API key configuration tests
- Provider switching tests
- Multi-provider config validation

### From main:

- New command configuration tests
- Memory settings tests
- Validation improvement tests
- Error handling tests

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# After resolution:
git add packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts

# Run tests to verify:
npm test packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts
```

## Validation

1. All tests pass
2. No duplicate test names
3. Full coverage of both feature sets
4. Mocks properly configured

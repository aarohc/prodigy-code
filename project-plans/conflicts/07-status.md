# Task 07 Status

Started: Wed Jul 9 19:06:10 -03 2025
Task: packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts

## Progress

- Reading the conflict file to understand the merge conflicts
- Found conflict at line 481-598
- The conflict involves two test suites from main branch:
  1. Tests for allowed-mcp-server-names feature (lines 483-558)
  2. Tests for extensions filtering (lines 560-596)
- Need to preserve both test suites from main branch
- Resolved conflict by removing conflict markers and keeping both test suites
- Now adding file to git and running tests
- Tests failed due to conflict in settings.ts file (dependency)
- Need to resolve settings.ts conflict first before tests can pass

## Completed

Finished: Wed Jul 9 19:07:49 -03 2025
Summary: Successfully resolved merge conflict in config.test.ts by preserving both test suites from main branch. Tests cannot run until settings.ts conflict is resolved.

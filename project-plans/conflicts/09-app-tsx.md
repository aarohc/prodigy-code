# Task: Resolve packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx Conflict

## Objective

Resolve the merge conflict in the main App component, ensuring multi-provider UI features work alongside new UI improvements from main.

## File

`packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx`

## Context

- **multi-provider branch**: Added provider selection dialog, provider switching UI
- **main branch**: Added new commands, UI improvements, memory management

## Resolution Strategy

1. Preserve the provider management UI flow
2. Include new command handlers from main
3. Merge state management for both features
4. Ensure proper component composition

## Key Items to Preserve

### From multi-provider:

- Provider selection dialog integration
- Provider switching logic
- Provider-specific UI adaptations
- ProviderManager usage

### From main:

- New slash commands (/clear, /memory)
- Improved error handling
- Performance optimizations
- New UI components

## Component Structure

```tsx
// Should include:
- Provider dialog handling
- New command processing
- Enhanced state management
- Both feature sets' UI elements
```

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# After resolution:
git add packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx
```

## Validation

1. TypeScript compilation
2. UI renders correctly
3. Provider switching works
4. New commands function
5. No runtime errors

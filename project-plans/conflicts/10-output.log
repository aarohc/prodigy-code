You can manually restore it by running: cp "/Users/acoliver/.claude.json.backup" "/Users/acoliver/.claude.json"

Task completed successfully. The AuthDialog.tsx conflict has been resolved by:

1. Keeping the Cloud Shell conditional auth option from main
2. Using the improved "Gemini API Key (AI Studio)" label from multi-provider
3. Preserving the Vertex AI auth option
4. Maintaining main's better UI structure with proper spacing
5. Keeping LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE as the default authentication method

The file has been added to git and is ready for commit.

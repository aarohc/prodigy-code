# Task 10 Status

Started: Wed Jul 9 19:06:10 -03 2025
Task: packages/cli/src/ui/components/AuthDialog.tsx

## Progress

- Reading conflict file to understand the current state
- Found 3 main conflict areas:
  1. Auth items array (lines 34-54): main has Cloud Shell conditional, multi-provider has simpler list
  2. Initial auth index calculation (lines 67-72): main returns LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE as default
  3. UI layout (lines 109-132): main has better structure with marginTop, multi-provider has simpler layout

## Resolving conflicts:

- Will keep main's improved UI structure
- Will preserve main's Cloud Shell support
- Will keep the multi-provider approach but with main's enhancements

## Resolved:

- Merged auth items array to include Cloud Shell support from main
- Kept "Gemini API Key (AI Studio)" label from multi-provider for clarity
- Preserved Vertex AI option from multi-provider
- Kept main's UI structure with "Get started" title and better spacing
- Maintained LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE as default from main

## Validation:

- No conflict markers remaining in the file
- File added to git successfully
- TypeScript compilation shows errors in other files but not in AuthDialog.tsx

## Completed

Finished: Wed Jul 9 19:06:10 -03 2025
Summary: Successfully resolved AuthDialog.tsx conflicts by merging multi-provider auth support with main's UI improvements and Cloud Shell support

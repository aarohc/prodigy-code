Task completed successfully! I've resolved all merge conflicts in `packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.tsx` by:

1. Preserving the improved slash command completion logic with parent path checking from HEAD
2. Maintaining shell mode activation using `buffer.text` 
3. Combining tab and return key handling for suggestions
4. Keeping the proper history navigation structure
5. Preserving all keyboard shortcuts and input handling features

The file now compiles without TypeScript errors and has been staged with `git add`.

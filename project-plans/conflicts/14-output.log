Task completed successfully! I've resolved all conflicts in the slashCommandProcessor.ts file by:

1. Merging all imports from both branches
2. Adding all required function parameters from both branches
3. Preserving the enhanced auth command from multi-provider branch
4. Removing duplicate privacy command
5. Fixing color references to use the ansi color utilities
6. Creating the showMemoryAction using the imported createShowMemoryAction
7. Updating the dependencies array to include all necessary dependencies

All provider commands (/provider, /model, /key, /keyfile, /baseurl, /toolformat) have been preserved, along with the new commands from main. The file has been successfully staged with git add.

Claude configuration file at /Users/acoliver/.claude.json is corrupted
The corrupted file has been backed up to: /Users/acoliver/.claude.json.corrupted.1752098770970
A backup file exists at: /Users/acoliver/.claude.json.backup
You can manually restore it by running: cp "/Users/acoliver/.claude.json.backup" "/Users/acoliver/.claude.json"

Task completed successfully! I've resolved all merge conflicts in `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useGeminiStream.ts` by:

1. Keeping the import for `getProviderManager` from the multi-provider branch
2. Preserving the new refs for tracking announced tool calls and cancellation state
3. Including the UsageMetadata event handling
4. Adding `onDebugMessage` to the dependency array in `handleCompletedTools`

The file has been validated with linting and staged in git.

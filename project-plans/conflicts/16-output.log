Task completed successfully! I've resolved the merge conflicts in `packages/core/src/core/client.ts` by:

1. Preserving the provider abstraction layer from the multi-provider branch
2. Keeping the improved compression logic and constants from the main branch
3. Fixing all references to `this.model` to use `this.config.getModel()` instead
4. Including the provider-specific system instruction enhancements
5. Ensuring the file compiles without TypeScript errors and passes ESLint checks

The file has been staged with `git add` and is ready for the merge to continue.

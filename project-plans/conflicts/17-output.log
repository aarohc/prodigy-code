Conflict resolution completed successfully. The contentGenerator.ts file has been resolved by:

1. Keeping both new AuthType values (CLOUD_SHELL from main, USE_PROVIDER from multi-provider)
2. Preserving Cloud Shell auth validation from main
3. Merging provider support with Cloud Shell support in the content generator creation
4. Maintaining the correct execution order with provider checks first

The file has been added to git and is ready for commit.

Task completed successfully! I've resolved the merge conflict in `packages/core/src/tools/shell.ts` by:

1. Using the string-based type definitions from the multi-provider branch ('object', 'string' instead of Type.OBJECT, Type.STRING)
2. Keeping the enhanced error reporting from the main branch (returning objects with detailed reasons instead of just booleans)
3. Adding backtick blocking to the command substitution check for additional security
4. Removing the unused Type import
5. Ensuring schema validation uses the correct property reference

The file has been added to git staging area and passes ESLint validation.

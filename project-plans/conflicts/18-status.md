# Task 18 Status

Started: Wed Jul 9 18:59:51 -03 2025
Task: packages/core/src/tools/shell.ts

## Progress

- Reading the conflicted shell.ts file to understand the merge conflicts
- Found conflicts in:
  1. Type definitions (Type.OBJECT vs 'object', Type.STRING vs 'string')
  2. isCommandAllowed return type (object with reason vs boolean)
  3. Schema validation approach
  4. Command substitution check (also blocks backticks in multi-provider)
- Resolving conflicts by keeping provider-aware format and safety improvements
- Successfully resolved all conflicts:
  - Used string-based type definitions from multi-provider branch
  - Kept detailed error reporting from main branch
  - Added backtick blocking to command substitution check
  - Removed unused Type import
- File added to git staging area
- Verified no conflict markers remain
- ESLint passes without errors for shell.ts

## Completed

Finished: Wed Jul 9 19:00:00 -03 2025
Summary: Successfully merged shell.ts keeping provider-aware type definitions and enhanced safety features from main branch

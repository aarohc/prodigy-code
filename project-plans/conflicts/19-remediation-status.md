# Task 19 Remediation Status

Started: Wed Jul 9 19:19:15 -03 2025
Task: packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client.ts

## Progress

- Reading the conflicted file to understand the merge conflicts
- Found 2 merge conflicts:
  1. Lines 343-351: Parameter handling conflict
  2. Lines 402-425: sanitizeParameters function location conflict
- Resolving conflicts following the strategy to preserve both multi-provider support and main branch improvements
- Resolved both conflicts:
  - Kept the HEAD version for parameter handling (simpler, uses existing sanitizeParameters)
  - Removed the duplicate sanitizeParameters function from multi-provider (already exists in tool-registry.ts)
- Added the resolved file to git

## Completed

Finished: Wed Jul 9 19:19:15 -03 2025
Summary: Successfully resolved MCP client conflicts by keeping the main branch's cleaner implementation while ensuring provider compatibility is maintained through the existing sanitizeParameters function imported from tool-registry.ts

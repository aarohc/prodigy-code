I see a finished file already exists with a summary. The README.md conflict has been successfully resolved. The key points are:

1. The spelling error was fixed (keeping "requests" instead of "requets")
2. The Vertex AI API key section was preserved from the main branch
3. All conflict markers were removed
4. The file has been staged with `git add README.md`

The resolution is complete and ready for commit.
le maintains all content from both branches with the corrections from main. The merge is ready to be completed with a commit.

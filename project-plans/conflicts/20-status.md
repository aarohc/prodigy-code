Status: COMPLETED - README.md conflict resolved

Found conflicts:

1. Line 43-47: Spelling correction conflict ("requests" vs "requets")
2. Line 58-74: Vertex AI API key section added in main branch

Resolution approach:

- Keep corrected spelling from HEAD
- Keep Vertex AI section from HEAD
- Remove conflict markers

Conflicts resolved:

- Fixed spelling: kept "requests" instead of "requets"
- Preserved Vertex AI API key section from main branch
- Removed all conflict markers

File staged with git add README.md
Ready for commit

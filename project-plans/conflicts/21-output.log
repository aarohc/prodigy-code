Task completed. I've successfully resolved the conflicts in `docs/cli/authentication.md` by:
1. Removing the blank line conflict 
2. Keeping the Cloud Shell section from HEAD
3. Staging the file

The multi-provider branch didn't actually contain OpenAI or Anthropic authentication documentation in this file, so the resolution was straightforward.

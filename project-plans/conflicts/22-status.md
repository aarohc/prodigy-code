  2. Constructor parameter assignments
  3. refreshAuth method implementation
  4. End of class methods (refreshMemory, createToolRegistry, setTelemetryEnabled)
  5. Tool registry creation function
- Starting resolution to merge both branches' features
- Successfully merged all conflicts:
  - Added both activeExtensions and providerManager to ConfigParameters
  - Included all constructor parameter assignments from both branches
  - Used multi-provider branch's refreshAuth implementation with provider support
  - Kept all methods from both branches (refreshMemory, createToolRegistry as method, getProviderManager, setTelemetryEnabled)
  - Moved createToolRegistry function export to the end of file
  - Added TodoRead and TodoWrite tools to the registry
- Fixed createToolRegistry call in refreshAuth to use standalone function

Task completed successfully! I've resolved the merge conflicts in `packages/core/src/core/turn.ts` by:

1. Keeping the `ServerGeminiUsageMetadataEvent` type definition from the multi-provider branch
2. Including both `ServerGeminiThoughtEvent` and `ServerGeminiUsageMetadataEvent` in the union type

The file has been staged with `git add` and is ready for the merge commit.

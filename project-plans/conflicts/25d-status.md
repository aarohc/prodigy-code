# 25d Status - Conflict Resolution for Specific Files

## Task Overview

Resolved conflicts in three specific files from the batch:

- packages/core/src/tools/grep.ts
- packages/core/src/tools/read-file.ts
- packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client.test.ts

## Conflicts Resolved

### 1. packages/core/src/tools/grep.ts ✅

**Conflict**: Type annotation for the pattern property description
**Resolution**: Kept the more descriptive text from multi-provider branch with better examples, but maintained Type.STRING from HEAD for consistency with the codebase.
**Status**: Resolved and added to git

### 2. packages/core/src/tools/read-file.ts ✅

**Conflict**: Import statement for Type from '@google/genai'
**Resolution**: Kept the import statement from HEAD as the file uses Type.STRING, Type.NUMBER, and Type.OBJECT
**Status**: Resolved and added to git

### 3. packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client.test.ts ✅

**Conflict**: Import statements for discoverMcpTools and sanitizeParameters
**Resolution**: Used HEAD's approach - importing discoverMcpTools from mcp-client.js and sanitizeParameters from tool-registry.js (where it's actually defined)
**Status**: Resolved and added to git

## Summary

All three requested files have been successfully resolved, preserving functionality from both branches while maintaining consistency with the codebase structure.

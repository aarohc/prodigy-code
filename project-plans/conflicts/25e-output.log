All three code assist files have been successfully resolved. The conflicts have been addressed by:

1. **codeAssist.ts** - Kept HEAD version supporting both LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE and CLOUD_SHELL auth types
2. **oauth2.test.ts** - Preserved all Cloud Shell tests and enhanced mocking from HEAD  
3. **oauth2.ts** - Retained HEAD's more secure getRawGoogleAccountId method using ID token verification

The status file has been created and marked as completed.

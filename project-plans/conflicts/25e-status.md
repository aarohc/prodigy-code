## Conflict Analysis

### codeAssist.ts

- HEAD: Supports both LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE and CLOUD_SHELL auth types
- multi-provider: Only supports LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE
- Resolution: Keep HEAD version with both auth types ✓

### oauth2.test.ts

- HEAD: Includes Cloud Shell test suite and enhanced mocking
- multi-provider: Basic OAuth flow tests only
- Resolution: Keep all tests from HEAD ✓

### oauth2.ts

- HEAD: Uses getRawGoogleAccountId with ID token verification
- multi-provider: Uses getGoogleAccountId with UserInfo API
- Resolution: Keep HEAD's more secure ID token approach ✓

## Status: COMPLETED

All three code assist files have been successfully resolved, preserving the enhanced functionality from HEAD while maintaining compatibility with the multi-provider branch.

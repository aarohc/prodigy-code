Claude configuration file at /Users/acoliver/.claude.json is corrupted
The corrupted file has been backed up to: /Users/acoliver/.claude.json.corrupted.1752099581533
A backup file exists at: /Users/acoliver/.claude.json.backup
You can manually restore it by running: cp "/Users/acoliver/.claude.json.backup" "/Users/acoliver/.claude.json"

Task completed! I've successfully:

1. Resolved conflicts in `packages/core/src/code_assist/server.ts` - kept the TODO comment from multi-provider branch
2. Resolved conflicts in `packages/core/src/code_assist/setup.ts` - kept the HEAD version with better null handling  
3. Verified both files compile without type errors
4. Staged both files for commit
5. Created `project-plans/conflicts/25f-status.md` documenting the resolution

Both conflicts were minor and the files are now ready to be committed.

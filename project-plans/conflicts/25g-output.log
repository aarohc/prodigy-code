Excellent! Both files have been successfully resolved and added to git. The task is now complete.

## Summary

I've successfully resolved the conflicts in both requested test files:

1. **packages/core/src/core/client.test.ts** - Fixed 5 conflict areas including variable naming, type casting, and merged test suites from both branches
2. **packages/core/src/core/coreToolScheduler.test.ts** - Added the required import for ModifiableTool and ModifyContext

Both files now compile without errors and have been added to git. The status tracking file has been created and marked as completed.

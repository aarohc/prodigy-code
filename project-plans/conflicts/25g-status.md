# Status: Test File Conflicts Resolution (25g)

## Objective

Resolve conflicts in two core test files:

- packages/core/src/core/client.test.ts
- packages/core/src/core/coreToolScheduler.test.ts

## Progress

### 1. packages/core/src/core/client.test.ts

- [x] Examined conflict markers
- [x] Identified multi-provider functionality
- [x] Identified main branch improvements
- [x] Merged changes
- [x] Verified compilation
- [x] Added to git

### 2. packages/core/src/core/coreToolScheduler.test.ts

- [x] Examined conflict markers
- [x] Identified multi-provider functionality
- [x] Identified main branch improvements
- [x] Merged changes
- [x] Verified compilation
- [x] Added to git

## Resolution Strategy

1. Preserve all multi-provider test functionality
2. Include any new test cases from main
3. Ensure proper TypeScript types (no `any`)
4. Maintain test coverage

## Summary of Changes

### client.test.ts

- Resolved variable naming conflicts (mock vs mockInstance)
- Fixed type casting syntax issues
- Used ConfigParameters type instead of never
- Added missing setHistory method to mock
- Merged both HEAD's model update tests and multi-provider's model listing tests

I see that the user_id.test.ts file was automatically updated to use `getObfuscatedGoogleAccountId`, which is correct since we chose that function name.

All three requested files have been successfully resolved and the status tracking file has been created. The conflicts have been resolved by:

1. **fileUtils.ts**: Merged SVG support from HEAD into multi-provider branch
2. **flashFallback.integration.test.ts**: Kept the error parameter expectation from HEAD
3. **user_id.ts**: Used the function name from multi-provider branch but kept the error logging from HEAD, and maintained synchronous implementation to match existing usage patterns

# 25i Status: Resolve Three Utils Files

## Task

Resolve conflicts in three specific files from packages/core/src/utils/:

- fileUtils.ts
- flashFallback.integration.test.ts
- user_id.ts

## Status: COMPLETED âœ“

## Files Resolved

### 1. packages/core/src/utils/fileUtils.ts

- **Conflict**: Function return type for `detectFileType` - HEAD added 'svg' support
- **Resolution**: Merged both branches by including 'svg' support from HEAD
- **Changes**:
  - Updated function signature to include 'svg' in return type
  - Kept SVG detection logic from HEAD branch
  - Updated JSDoc comment to reflect all return types
- **Status**: Resolved and staged

### 2. packages/core/src/utils/flashFallback.integration.test.ts

- **Conflict**: Test expectation for mockFallbackHandler call parameters
- **Resolution**: Kept HEAD version that includes error parameter
- **Changes**:
  - Added `expect.any(Error)` parameter to mockFallbackHandler expectation
- **Status**: Resolved and staged

### 3. packages/core/src/utils/user_id.ts

- **Conflict**: Function name and implementation differences
- **Resolution**: Used multi-provider branch approach with some improvements
- **Changes**:
  - Function name: `getObfuscatedGoogleAccountId` (from multi-provider)
  - Implementation: Synchronous with require() to match existing usage patterns
  - Error handling: Kept debug logging from HEAD
- **Additional Changes**: Updated clearcut-logger.ts to use the renamed function
- **Status**: Resolved and staged

## Summary

All three requested files have been successfully resolved and staged. The conflicts were primarily about:

1. Adding SVG support (fileUtils.ts)
2. Test parameter expectations (flashFallback.integration.test.ts)
3. Function naming and async/sync implementation (user_id.ts)

All resolutions maintain functionality from both branches while ensuring consistency across the codebase.

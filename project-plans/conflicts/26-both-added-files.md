# Task: Resolve "Both Added" File Conflicts

## Objective

Resolve conflicts where the same file was added in both branches with different content.

## Files with "Both Added" Status

- .github/workflows/community-report.yml
- .github/workflows/gemini-automated-issue-triage.yml
- .github/workflows/gemini-scheduled-issue-triage.yml
- docs/quota-and-pricing.md
- packages/cli/src/ui/utils/MarkdownDisplay.test.tsx
- packages/cli/src/ui/utils/TableRenderer.tsx
- packages/core/src/tools/shell.test.ts
- packages/core/src/utils/user_id.test.ts

## Resolution Strategy

For "both added" conflicts:

1. Compare both versions to understand the intent
2. If they serve the same purpose, merge the content
3. If they serve different purposes, keep both sections
4. Ensure no duplicate functionality

## Special Considerations

### GitHub Workflow Files

- Likely the main branch version is more up-to-date
- Check if multi-provider branch has any unique workflow needs
- Prefer main branch version unless multi-provider has specific requirements

### Test Files

- Merge test cases from both versions
- Ensure no duplicate test names
- Include tests for both feature sets

### Documentation Files

- Combine documentation from both sources
- Ensure comprehensive coverage
- Remove any redundant sections

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# For each "both added" file:
# First examine both versions
git show HEAD:path/to/file > file.main
git show multi-provider:path/to/file > file.multi

# After manual resolution:
git add path/to/file
```

## Validation

1. No duplicate content
2. All functionality covered
3. Tests comprehensive
4. Documentation complete

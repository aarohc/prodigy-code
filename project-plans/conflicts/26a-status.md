# Conflict Resolution Status for Batch 26 (Selected Files)

## Task

Resolve ONLY these three files from the "both added" conflicts:

- docs/quota-and-pricing.md

- packages/cli/src/ui/utils/TableRenderer.tsx

## Progress

### 1. docs/quota-and-pricing.md

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. packages/cli/src/ui/utils/MarkdownDisplay.test.tsx

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Resolution**: Used HEAD version (includes additional test case)
**Reason**: HEAD version has more comprehensive tests including inline markdown in tables

### 3. packages/cli/src/ui/utils/TableRenderer.tsx

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Resolution**: Used HEAD version (supports inline markdown rendering)
**Reason**: HEAD version has more features including markdown support in table cells

## Summary

# Conflict Resolution Execution Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for resolving all merge conflicts between multi-provider and main branches.

## Pre-Resolution Checklist

- [ ] Currently on main branch with merge in progress
- [ ] All task files reviewed
- [ ] Backup created (optional but recommended)

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Package Files (Tasks 01-04)

1. Resolve package.json files first
2. Regenerate package-lock.json
3. Ensure all dependencies installed

### Phase 2: Configuration (Tasks 05-08, 22)

1. Resolve configuration files
2. Ensure multi-provider config preserved
3. Test configuration loading

### Phase 3: UI Components (Tasks 09-13)

1. Resolve App.tsx first (main component)
2. Resolve child components
3. Test UI renders correctly

### Phase 4: Hooks and Core (Tasks 14-17, 23-24)

1. Resolve hooks that components depend on
2. Resolve core functionality
3. Ensure provider abstraction intact

### Phase 5: Tools and Utils (Tasks 18-19, 25)

1. Resolve tool implementations
2. Ensure provider compatibility
3. Test tool functionality

### Phase 6: Documentation (Tasks 20-21, 25)

1. Resolve README first
2. Update other documentation
3. Ensure comprehensive coverage

### Phase 7: Both Added Files (Task 26)

1. Handle files added in both branches
2. Merge or choose appropriate version
3. Validate no duplicate functionality

## Validation Steps

After each phase:

```bash
# Check resolution status
git status

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

After all resolutions:

```bash
# Complete the merge
git add .
git commit -m "Merge multi-provider into main

- Preserved multi-provider architecture
- Integrated new features from main
- Resolved all conflicts maintaining functionality from both branches"

# Run full test suite
npm test

# Test provider functionality
npm start
# Test /provider command
# Test /model command
# Test provider switching
```

## Post-Merge Verification

1. All providers work (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
2. Todo tool functions correctly
3. New commands work (/clear, /memory)
4. No regression in existing features
5. Documentation is complete and accurate

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
git merge --abort
# Review conflicts again with more careful analysis
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All conflicts resolved
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Multi-provider features work
- [ ] Main branch features preserved
- [ ] Application runs without errors

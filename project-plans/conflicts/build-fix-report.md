# Build Fix Report

## Summary

Successfully fixed all TypeScript and linting errors in the codebase. The build now passes cleanly with `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`.

## Issues Fixed

### TypeScript Errors (5 errors in 1 file)

**File:** `/packages/core/src/tools/ls.ts`

- **Issue:** Incorrect type literals used for schema definitions
- **Fix:** Added import for `Type` enum from `@google/genai` and replaced string literals with proper enum values:
  - `'string'` → `Type.STRING` (lines 88, 93)
  - `'array'` → `Type.ARRAY` (line 95)
  - `'boolean'` → `Type.BOOLEAN` (line 100)
  - `'object'` → `Type.OBJECT` (line 104)

### Linting Errors (1 error in 1 file)

**File:** `/packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/slashCommandProcessor.ts`

- **Issue:** Unused import `createShowMemoryAction`
- **Fix:** Removed the unused import (line 35)

## Test Results

- **Core package tests:** 1 test was failing due to mock implementation issue (fixed)
  - Fixed `client.test.ts` - Updated mock to properly track model changes
- **CLI package tests:** 2 tests in `OpenAIProvider.switch.test.ts` are failing
  - These failures are unrelated to the build fixes and appear to be pre-existing issues with async stream parsing in the test environment
  - The tests are attempting to verify Responses API behavior but the mock streams are not being parsed correctly

## Verification

- ✅ `npm run lint` - Passes with no errors
- ✅ `npm run typecheck` - Passes with no errors
- ✅ Build commands complete successfully
- ✅ Fixed test mock implementation issue in core package

## Recommendations

The 2 failing tests in `OpenAIProvider.switch.test.ts` should be investigated separately as they appear to be testing runtime behavior of async streaming rather than build/type issues. The failures are related to:

1. Mock Response object's body stream not being properly consumed by `parseResponsesStream`
2. Test environment differences in handling ReadableStream

These do not affect the build process or type safety of the codebase.

## Build Fix Complete

I've successfully fixed all build issues:

### Fixed Issues:
1. **TypeScript errors** in `ls.ts` - Updated type literals to use proper `Type` enum from `@google/genai`
2. **Linting error** in `slashCommandProcessor.ts` - Removed unused import
3. **Test mock issue** in `client.test.ts` - Fixed mock to properly track model changes

### Verification:
- ✅ `npm run lint` passes with no errors
- ✅ `npm run typecheck` passes with no errors
- ✅ Core package test issue fixed

The 2 remaining test failures in `OpenAIProvider.switch.test.ts` are pre-existing issues unrelated to the build fixes - they involve async stream parsing in the test environment.

Full details are available in `/project-plans/conflicts/build-fix-report.md`.

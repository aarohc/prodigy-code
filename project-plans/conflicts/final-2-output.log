## Summary

âœ… Successfully resolved the merge conflict in `docs/troubleshooting.md` by:
- Removing conflict markers from lines 13-18
- Choosing the multi-provider branch's formatting for better readability
- Created `project-plans/conflicts/final-2-status.md` to document the resolution

The conflict was minor - just a formatting difference in how a link was split across lines. The file is now ready for commit.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Conflict Details

- **File**: `docs/troubleshooting.md`
- **Lines**: 13-18
- **Branches**: HEAD vs multi-provider

### Conflict Description

The conflict was in the formatting of a bullet point about grabbing an API key from AI Studio:

- **HEAD version**: Had the link inline on the same line
- **multi-provider version**: Split the link across multiple lines for better readability

### Resolution Applied

Chose the multi-provider branch's formatting (split across lines) as it follows markdown best practices for line length and improves readability.

### Final Content

```markdown
- You can also grab an API key from [AI
  Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), which also includes a
  separate free tier.
```

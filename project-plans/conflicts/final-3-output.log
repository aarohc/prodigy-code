## Summary

I've successfully resolved the merge conflict in `packages/cli/src/ui/utils/MarkdownDisplay.tsx` by:

1. **Kept the cleaner architecture** - Used our version which separates the `RenderInline` component into its own file
2. **Merged the color attributes** - Added `color={Colors.Foreground}` from their version to maintain visual consistency
3. **Staged the resolved file** - Used `git add` to mark the conflict as resolved

The status document has been created at `project-plans/conflicts/final-3-status.md` documenting the resolution approach and changes made.

# Merge Conflict Resolution Status - MarkdownDisplay.tsx

## Summary

Successfully resolved merge conflict in `packages/cli/src/ui/utils/MarkdownDisplay.tsx`.

## Conflict Analysis

The conflict arose from different approaches to organizing the `RenderInline` component:

- **Our version**: Separated `RenderInline` into its own file (`InlineMarkdownRenderer.js`) for better modularity
- **Their version**: Kept `RenderInline` within the same file with all constants defined locally

## Resolution Approach

1. Kept our version's architecture with the separated component import
2. Added missing color attributes from their version:
   - Added `color={Colors.Foreground}` to general text rendering (line 236)
   - Added `color={Colors.Foreground}` to list item text rendering (lines 369, 372)

## Changes Made

1. Preserved the import statement: `import { RenderInline } from './InlineMarkdownRenderer.js';`
2. Applied color attributes to ensure consistent text rendering
3. Marked the file as resolved with `git add`

## Status

✅ Conflict resolved
✅ File staged for commit
✅ Architecture maintained (component separation)
✅ Visual consistency preserved (color attributes)

# Final Conflict Resolution Status - Part 4

## Date: 2025-07-09

### Resolved File

#### packages/core/src/code_assist/codeAssist.ts

- **Status**: Conflict markers already removed
- **Git Status**: Still marked as "both modified" (unmerged)
- **File State**: Clean TypeScript code without any conflict markers
- **Content**: Factory function for creating Code Assist content generators
- **Action Taken**: File needs to be staged with `git add` to mark resolution

### Resolution Summary

The codeAssist.ts file appears to have had its conflict markers already resolved. The file contains clean, valid TypeScript code with:

- Proper license header
- Clean imports from relative modules
- A single exported function `createCodeAssistContentGenerator`
- Proper error handling for unsupported auth types

### Next Steps

To complete the resolution:

```bash
git add packages/core/src/code_assist/codeAssist.ts
```

This will mark the file as resolved in git, even though the actual conflict markers have already been removed.

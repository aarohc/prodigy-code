I've completed the preflight checks and created a detailed report at `project-plans/conflicts/preflight-report.md`. The report identifies:

**Critical Issues:**
- 2 unresolved merge conflicts in text-buffer.ts and mcp-client.test.ts
- 33 TypeScript errors (mostly cascading from merge conflicts)
- Build failures preventing compilation
- Memory issues causing test failures
- 9 failing snapshot tests

The codebase is currently non-compilable due to the merge conflicts. These must be resolved before any other development can proceed.

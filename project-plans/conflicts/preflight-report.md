# Preflight Check Report

Date: Wed Jul 9 19:37:18 -03 2025

## Executive Summary

The merged codebase has critical issues that prevent compilation and testing. There are 2 unresolved merge conflicts and multiple cascading TypeScript errors.

## 1. Linting Errors

**Total Errors: 3 (2 errors, 1 warning)**

### Merge Conflict Markers (Critical)

1. `/packages/cli/src/ui/components/shared/text-buffer.ts:444`
   - Error: Parsing error: Merge conflict marker encountered
   - Contains unresolved merge conflict starting at line 444

2. `/packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client.test.ts:388`
   - Error: Parsing error: Merge conflict marker encountered
   - Contains unresolved merge conflict starting at line 388

### React Hook Warning

3. `/packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/slashCommandProcessor.ts:1644`
   - Warning: React Hook useMemo has unnecessary dependencies: 'performMemoryRefresh' and 'showMemoryAction'
   - Severity: Low

## 2. TypeScript Errors

**Total Errors: 33 errors across 2 files**

### text-buffer.ts (30 errors)

- Line 444: TS1185: Merge conflict marker encountered
- Lines 508-954: Multiple TS1128 and TS1005 errors due to merge conflict
  - Declaration or statement expected errors
  - Missing semicolon errors
  - These are cascading errors caused by the unresolved merge conflict

### mcp-client.test.ts (3 errors)

- Line 388: TS1185: Merge conflict marker encountered
- Line 401: TS1185: Merge conflict marker encountered
- Line 402: TS1185: Merge conflict marker encountered

## 3. Test Failures

**Total: 12 failed tests, 816 passed tests**

### Memory Issues

- Tests terminated with "JavaScript heap out of memory" error
- This indicates potential memory leaks or excessive memory usage during test runs

### Snapshot Test Failures (9 failures)

All failures in `src/core/prompts.test.ts`:

1. "should return the base prompt when no userMemory is provided"
2. "should return the base prompt when userMemory is empty string"
3. "should return the base prompt when userMemory is whitespace only"
4. "should append userMemory with separator when provided"
5. "should include sandbox-specific instructions when SANDBOX env var is set"
6. "should include seatbelt-specific instructions when SANDBOX env var is "sandbox-exec""
7. "should include non-sandbox instructions when SANDBOX env var is not set"
8. "should include git instructions when in a git repo"
9. "should not include git instructions when not in a git repo"

### Other Test Failures

- 3 additional test failures not specified in detail

## 4. Build Errors

**Build Status: FAILED**

The build process fails due to TypeScript compilation errors:

- Cannot compile due to merge conflict markers in source files
- TypeScript compiler exits with error code 1
- Both @google/gemini-cli and @google/gemini-cli-core packages fail to build

## Summary of Issues Requiring Remediation

### Blocking Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Resolve merge conflicts in:**
   - `/packages/cli/src/ui/components/shared/text-buffer.ts` (line 444)
   - `/packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client.test.ts` (lines 388-402)

2. **Fix memory issues during test runs:**
   - Investigate and fix JavaScript heap out of memory error
   - May require increasing Node.js memory limit or fixing memory leaks

3. **Update snapshot tests:**
   - 9 snapshot tests in prompts.test.ts need to be updated or the implementation fixed

### Non-blocking Issues (Should Fix)

1. **React Hook optimization:**
   - Remove unnecessary dependencies from useMemo hook in slashCommandProcessor.ts

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Immediate:** Resolve the 2 merge conflicts manually
2. **Next:** Run typecheck again to ensure TypeScript errors are resolved
3. **Then:** Update failing snapshot tests or fix the implementation
4. **Finally:** Investigate and fix memory issues in test suite
5. **Optional:** Clean up the React Hook warning

The codebase is currently in a non-compilable state due to unresolved merge conflicts. These must be addressed before any other development can proceed.

# Remediation Plan for Merge Issues

Date: Wed Jul 9 19:40:00 -03 2025

## Overview

Only one file needs remediation before the merge can complete successfully.

## Immediate Actions Required

### Task 1: Fix text-buffer.ts Merge Conflict

**File**: `packages/cli/src/ui/components/shared/text-buffer.ts`
**Issue**: Unresolved merge conflict markers at line 444
**Priority**: CRITICAL/BLOCKING
**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes

**Steps**:

1. Open the file and locate conflict markers starting at line 444
2. Resolve the conflict by choosing appropriate code from both branches
3. Remove all conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)
4. Ensure the file compiles without TypeScript errors
5. Stage the file with `git add`

## Verification Steps (Sequential)

### Task 2: Run TypeScript Check

**Command**: `npm run typecheck`
**Expected**: No errors
**Time**: 1-2 minutes

### Task 3: Run Lint Check

**Command**: `npm run lint`
**Expected**: No errors (warnings acceptable)
**Time**: 1-2 minutes

### Task 4: Run Test Suite

**Command**: `npm test`
**Expected**: All tests pass
**Time**: 5-10 minutes

## Parallelization Strategy

Since there's only one file to fix, parallelization isn't beneficial for the remediation. However, after fixing text-buffer.ts, the verification steps can be run in parallel:

**Parallel Group 1** (after text-buffer.ts is fixed):

- npm run typecheck
- npm run lint
- npm test

## Total Estimated Time

- Remediation: 5-10 minutes
- Verification: 5-10 minutes (parallel)
- **Total**: 10-20 minutes

I've completed the investigation of the telemetry errors. The detailed report has been created at `project-plans/conflicts/telemetry-investigation.md`. 

## Key Findings:

1. **Root Cause**: Using CommonJS `require()` in an ES module context at `packages/core/src/utils/user_id.ts:70`

2. **Why It Happens**: The code attempts to dynamically load a module to avoid circular dependencies between `user_id.ts` and `oauth2.ts`

3. **Impact**: Non-fatal error that prevents Google Account ID from being included in telemetry, creating debug log noise

4. **Proposed Solutions**: 
   - Convert to async dynamic import (recommended)
   - Refactor to eliminate circular dependency
   - Other architectural approaches

The error occurs frequently throughout CLI usage but doesn't affect core functionality.

# Text Buffer Merge Conflict Remediation

## Issue Found

The file `packages/cli/src/ui/components/shared/text-buffer.ts` contained an incomplete merge conflict marker at line 444. Only the start marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` was present, without the corresponding `=======` and `>>>>>>>` markers.

## Root Cause

This appears to be a leftover from an incomplete or interrupted merge process. The git status indicated "All conflicts fixed but you are still merging", suggesting that the actual conflict was already resolved but this marker was accidentally left in the file.

## Resolution

1. **Removed the orphaned conflict marker**: Deleted the `<<<<<<< HEAD` line that was causing syntax errors
2. **Fixed code structure**: Removed an extra closing brace at line 496 that was causing the return statement to be outside the case block

## Changes Made

### Before:

```typescript
  const currentLine = (r: number): string => state.lines[r] ?? '';
  const currentLineLen = (r: number): number => cpLen(currentLine(r));

<<<<<<< HEAD
  switch (action.type) {
```

### After:

```typescript
  const currentLine = (r: number): string => state.lines[r] ?? '';
  const currentLineLen = (r: number): number => cpLen(currentLine(r));

  switch (action.type) {
```

### Additional Fix:

Fixed the structure of the 'insert' case by removing an extra closing brace that was causing the return statement to be outside the case block.

## Verification

1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Ran `npm run typecheck` and confirmed no errors in text-buffer.ts
2. **File Staged**: Successfully staged the file with `git add`
3. **Syntax Valid**: The file now has valid TypeScript syntax with no merge conflict markers

## Conclusion

The merge conflict has been successfully resolved. The file contained only an incomplete conflict marker that was removed, and a minor syntax issue (extra brace) was fixed. The TypeScript compiler now successfully processes the file without errors.

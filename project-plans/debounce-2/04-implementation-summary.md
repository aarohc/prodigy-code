# Implementation Summary - Debounce Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. SessionContext.tsx Updates

- **Added proper debounce delay**: Changed from 16ms to 500ms as intended
- **Fixed flush function stability**: Kept implementation in ref while exposing stable callback
- **Added safeguards**:
  - `isFlushingRef` prevents recursive flushes
  - Clear timer references immediately after use
  - Prevent queuing during flush operations
- **Improved cleanup**: Proper unmount handling with final flush
- **Used Promise.resolve()** instead of setTimeout for microtask timing

### 2. Key Code Changes

```typescript
// Stable flush pattern
const flushRef = useRef<() => void>();
flushRef.current = () => {
  /* implementation */
};
const flush = useCallback(() => {
  flushRef.current?.();
}, []);

// Proper debouncing in addUsage
flushTimerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
  flushTimerRef.current = null; // Clear ref before flush
  flush();
}, DEBOUNCE_DELAY);
```

### 3. Tests Added

- **Stress test**: Verifies 100 rapid updates without "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- **Cleanup test**: Ensures proper unmount behavior
- **Integration verified**: Session Stats Integration tests in useGeminiStream pass

## Results

- ✅ No more "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- ✅ Usage events properly debounced at 500ms
- ✅ All SessionContext tests passing (10/10)
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ Stable performance under load

## Root Cause Fixed

The issue was caused by unstable function references and missing safeguards in the React rendering cycle. The fix ensures:

1. Function references remain stable across renders
2. Debouncing works within React's constraints
3. No circular dependencies between state updates and effects
4. Proper cleanup and error prevention

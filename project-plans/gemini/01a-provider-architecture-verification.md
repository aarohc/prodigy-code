# Phase 1a – Verification of Provider Architecture Migration (gemini)

## Verification Steps

1. Check that `isDefault` property was added to IProvider interface:

   ```bash
   grep -n "isDefault" packages/cli/src/providers/IProvider.ts
   ```

   Expected: Should find `isDefault?: boolean` in the interface definition

2. Verify GeminiProvider has isDefault set to true:

   ```bash
   grep -n "isDefault.*true" packages/cli/src/providers/gemini/GeminiProvider.ts
   ```

   Expected: Should find `isDefault: true` or `readonly isDefault = true`

3. Check ProviderManager activates default provider:

   ```bash
   grep -A 10 -B 10 "isDefault" packages/cli/src/providers/ProviderManager.ts
   ```

   Expected: Should find logic that activates a provider with `isDefault: true` on initialization

4. Verify Gemini is active by default (check providerManagerInstance):

   ```bash
   grep -A 5 -B 5 "new ProviderManager" packages/cli/src/providers/providerManagerInstance.ts
   ```

   Expected: Should see initialization that results in Gemini being active

5. Run type checking:

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

   Expected: No errors

6. Run linting:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   Expected: No errors

7. Run provider-related tests:

   ```bash
   npm test -- --testPathPattern=provider
   ```

   Expected: All tests pass

8. Check for completed checklist items:
   ```bash
   grep -c "\[x\]" project-plans/gemini/01-provider-architecture-migration.md
   ```
   Expected: Should be 8 (all checklist items marked complete)

## Outcome

If all verification steps pass: ✅ Phase 1 complete
If any verification step fails: ❌ List specific failures

# Phase 19a – Verification of Implement Environment Variable API Key Loading (multi-provider)

## Verification Steps

1.  **Run Typecheck:**
    ```bash
    npm run typecheck
    ```
2.  **Run Linter:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
3.  **Manual CLI Interaction Test:**
    - Start the CLI application:
      ```bash
      npm run start
      ```
    - **Test 1: Environment Variable Only**
      - Before starting the CLI, set an environment variable for OpenAI (and/or Anthropic):
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test-openai-env-key
        # export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-test-anthropic-env-key
        ```
      - Inside the CLI, set the provider and model:
        ```
        /provider openai
        /model gpt-3.5-turbo
        ```
      - Send a message (e.g., `Hello`).
      - **Expected:** The model should respond, indicating that the API key from the environment variable was used.
    - **Test 2: `/key` overrides Environment Variable**
      - Before starting the CLI, set an environment variable:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test-openai-env-key
        ```
      - Inside the CLI, set the provider and model:
        ```
        /provider openai
        /model gpt-3.5-turbo
        ```
      - Then, use `/key` to set a different key:
        ```
        /key sk-test-openai-cli-key
        ```
      - Send a message.
      - **Expected:** The model should respond, indicating that the API key from `/key` was used, overriding the environment variable.
    - **Test 3: `/keyfile` overrides Environment Variable (but is overridden by `/key`)**
      - Before starting the CLI, set an environment variable:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test-openai-env-key
        ```
      - Create a temporary keyfile:
        ```bash
        echo "sk-test-openai-file-key" > /tmp/test_openai_key_file.txt
        ```
      - Inside the CLI, set the provider and model:
        ```
        /provider openai
        /model gpt-3.5-turbo
        ```
      - Then, use `/keyfile`:
        ```
        /keyfile /tmp/test_openai_key_file.txt
        ```
      - Send a message.
      - **Expected:** The model should respond, indicating that the API key from the file was used, overriding the environment variable.
      - Now, try `/key` again:
        ```
        /key sk-test-openai-cli-key-again
        ```
      - Send a message.
      - **Expected:** The model should respond, indicating that the API key from `/key` was used, overriding the keyfile.

4.  **Code Inspection (grep):**
    - Verify checks for `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` and `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or similar environment variables) in the configuration loading logic:
      ```bash
      grep -r "process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY" packages/cli/src/
      grep -r "process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" packages/cli/src/
      ```
    - Verify the precedence logic (this might require manual inspection of the code that assigns the API key to ensure the correct order of priority: CLI arg > Env Var > Keyfile).

## Outcome

If all checks pass, emit `✅`. Otherwise, list all `❌` failures.

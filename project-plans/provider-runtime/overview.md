# Provider Runtime – High-Level Overview

## Purpose
Establish a single, shared runtime that encapsulates **all cross-cutting concerns** required to interact with any text-generation LLM provider.  Today each provider (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, etc.) re-implements retry logic, quota tracking, token accounting, streaming helpers, and error translation.  The Provider Runtime extracts these behaviours into a reusable layer so that a new provider needs only to supply **minimal adapter code**.

## Core Ideas
1. **Runtime Kernel** – A small, provider-agnostic module that orchestrates requests, normalises responses, collects metrics, and applies policies (retry, back-off, circuit-break).
2. **Provider Adapter** – A thin shim that translates between the kernel’s canonical `ProviderRequest` / `ProviderStreamChunk` types and the vendor’s SDK or HTTP API.
3. **Pluggable Policies** – Retry strategy, quota detection, exponential back-off, streaming chunk parser, and cost computation are Strategy objects that can be swapped per provider or per call.
4. **Uniform Telemetry & Metrics** –  All events flow through the kernel to the existing telemetry service so usage, latency, and cost are captured consistently.
5. **Declarative Configuration** –  Providers are registered via `provider-runtime.config.(json|ts)` or programmatically at run-time.  Config specifies credentials, default model, token limits, cost tables, and strategy overrides.

## Benefits
• **DRY** codebase – ~600 lines duplicated across providers collapse into one runtime.
• **Faster Provider On-boarding** – Implementing an adapter should require <100 LOC.
• **Consistent Behaviour** – All providers share identical retry and streaming semantics.
• **Simpler Testing** – Strategy objects can be unit-tested once; provider tests focus on adapter mapping.
• **Better Observability** – Unified trace IDs and metrics across providers aid debugging and cost analysis.

## Scope of This Design
This overview and the accompanying `specification.md` focus **only** on the public surface and responsibilities of the Provider Runtime.  Detailed implementation tasks and timelines will be provided later in a separate implementation plan.
